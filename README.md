# Contact Form Component with API Integration

This is a **Contact Form** component designed for my portfolio website. It is built with **React** and uses **ShadCN UI** components for styling and **Toast Notifications** for feedback. The form collects a user's name, email, and message, which are then sent to a backend API for processing. The form also integrates with **Hygraph (GraphCMS)** for storing submissions and **Nodemailer** to send email notifications.

## Features

- **Contact Form**: Collects the user's name, email, and message.
- **API Integration**: Form submissions are processed by an API endpoint.
- **Toast Notifications**: Success and error feedback displayed using ShadCN Toast.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends a notification email upon successful form submission.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly form layout.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework.
- **ShadCN UI**: UI components for the form and toast notifications.
- **GraphQL**: Used for submitting form data to Hygraph (GraphCMS).
- **Node.js**: Backend for processing form data.
- **Nodemailer**: Sends email notifications upon form submission.

## Usage

### Contact Form

- The form collects the userâ€™s name, email, and message, and sends this data to a backend API.

### API Handler

- The API endpoint `pages/api/contact.js` handles the form data, saves it to **Hygraph** (GraphCMS), and sends an email notification using **Nodemailer**.

### Toast Notifications

- Upon submission, a toast notification displays a success or error message, notifying the user of the form submission status.

## Customization

- **API Integration**: Modify the `pages/api/contact.js` file to integrate with a different backend or service.
- **Toast Feedback**: Customize the success or error messages shown in the toast notifications.
